**Simple Linear Regression**
    - Dataset - Salary_Data.csv

    - y = bo + b1*x
    - One Independent Variable only
    - Ordinary Least Square 
    - sklearn LinearRegression
    - To predict for a new data, Pass data in 2 dimension
    
**Multiple Linear Regression**
    - Dataset - 50_Startups.csv

    - y = bo + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... +bn Xn
    - sklearn LinearRegression
    - Scikit learn takes care of selecting Statistically significant features 
    - Scikit learn takes care of Dummy variable trap 
    - Multiple Regression  - no need to do Feature Scaling as each feature is mulitplied by coefficient
        - and coefficients compensate high values
    - To predict for a new data, Pass data in 2 dimension
